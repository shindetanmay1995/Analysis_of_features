Problem Defination : Visualize data by correlating and comparing features from 500 datasets of parameters of drone such as velocity, acceleration with climatic and physical parameters like wind direction and magnitude. Making sense out of raw and undefined data by deriving useful insights that could play part in boosting the strategy and sales of a product.

An electromechanically actuated launcher accelerates the drones — known internally 
as a "Zip" — at 5 g's from 0 to 30 m/s (67 mph) in less than a second. From there, the plane autonomously 
navigates a pre-defined route to the delivery site, drops its package, and returns to the distribution center to 
recover.

Data Description : This directory contains 448 csv files, from which 447 depict recorded values of a drone as rows(1001 rows) and featuers of drones as it's columns 

A `flight_XXXXX.csv` file for each flight in the dataset. Each file contains the following signals from 5 seconds prior to launch, to 15 seconds after launch, logged at approximately 50Hz:

Column Names | Units | Description
--- |:---:| -----:
`seconds_since_launch` | seconds | time since launch
`position_ned_m[0]` | meters | position of the zip relative to a fixed reference point in the north direction
`position_ned_m[1]` | meters | position of the zip relative to a fixed reference point in the east direction
`position_ned_m[2]` | meters | position of the zip relative to a fixed reference point in the down direction
`velocity_ned_mps[0]` | meters/second | velocity of the zip, in the north direction
`velocity_ned_mps[1]` | meters/second | velocity of the zip, in the east direction
`velocity_ned_mps[2]` | meters/second | velocity of the zip, in the down direction
`accel_body_mps2[0]` | meters/second^2 | acceleration of the zip, in the body-forward direction
`accel_body_mps2[1]` | meters/second^2 | acceleration of the zip, in the body-right direction
`accel_body_mps2[2]` | meters/second^2 | acceleration of the zip, in the body-down direction
`orientation_rad[0]` | radians | Euler (Tait-Bryan) roll of the zip
`orientation_rad[1]` | radians | Euler (Tait-Bryan) pitch of the zip
`orientation_rad[2]` | radians | Euler (Tait-Bryan) yaw of the zip
`angular_rate_body_radps[0]` | radians/second | Angular velocity of the zip, about the body-forward direction
`angular_rate_body_radps[1]` | radians/second | Angular velocity of the zip, about the body-right direction
`angular_rate_body_radps[2]` | radians/second | Angular velocity of the zip, about the body-down direction
`position_sigma_ned_m[0]` | meters | estimated standard error of position_ned_m[0], i.e. positional uncertainty in the north direction
`position_sigma_ned_m[1]` | meters | estimated standard error of position_ned_m[1], i.e. positional uncertainty in the east direction
`position_sigma_ned_m[2]` | meters | estimated standard error of position_ned_m[2], i.e. positional uncertainty in the down direction

The 448th csv contains factors or columns affecting the flight patters of each drone during it's flight. So, this data set contains 447 rows (each row describing an individual drone) and factors that affected it's flight pattern.

A `summary_data.csv` file containing the following data for each flight in the dataset:

Column Names | Units | Description
--- |:---:| -----:
`flight_id` | n/a | unique identifier for the flight
`battery_serial_number` | n/a | serial number of the battery
`body_serial_number` | n/a | serial number of the body
`wing_serial_number` | n/a | serial number of the wing
`commit` | n/a | git commit SHA representing the version of software
`launch_airspeed` | meters/second | airspeed of the plane during launch
`launch_groundspeed` | meters/second | groundspeed of the plane during launch
`launch_timestamp` | n/a | time string `YYYT-MM-DD HH:MM:SS CAT` where CAT, i.e. Central Africa Time, is the timezone
`preflight_voltage` | volts | dc voltage of the battery immediately prior to launch
`air_temperature` | celsius | air temperature during launch
`rel_humidity` | percentage | relative humidity during launch
`static_pressure` | pascals | static air pressure during launch
`wind_direction` | degrees | direction of the wind during launch, with 0 blowing to the north, 90 blowing to the east
`wind_magnitude` | meters/second | magnitude of the wind during launch
